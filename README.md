----------------CAPUT REPOSITORY README-------------------

This repository contains documentation and source code of a 
reengineering project. Where we (my collaborators and I) ported
and old QBasic game Gorillas over to Java.

With that we made the game object oriented based as well as
increased the framerate from the original game.

Here you can view the original game:
https://classicreload.com/qbasic-gorillas.html
You can also view the orignal code within our Gorillas folder.

To view our source files go into Beta Version, and then DankGorillas.

Collaborators: Kyle Kwazniski, Steven Hartnett, Jonah Tollefson
